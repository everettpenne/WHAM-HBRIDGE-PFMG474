 * FIRE
 *
 * Begins PWM output by (re)starting playback of whatever table is
 * currently uploaded, from step 0. No ARM/state-machine interlock
 * exists in this minimal firmware -- FIRE always takes effect
 * immediately, whether the controller was idle or already mid-shot
 * (PFM_Restart() is safe to call in either case: it always resets to
 * step 0 and re-applies HRTIM1_PWM_Start()). If a fuller state machine
 * (ARM/interlock, matching the sibling PFM-STM32G474 project's
 * SM_Fire()) is ever needed here, this is the call site to extend, not
 * replace. Fault gating (below) is the first, narrow piece of that --
 * not a full state machine.
 *
 * Two guards, checked in this order (both cheap, order doesn't
 * otherwise matter): a latched hardware fault (PC10/HRTIM1_FLT6, see
 * hrtim.h) is checked first -- the outputs are already safe in
 * hardware regardless, but firing straight into a still-tripped fault
 * would be a confusing "OK" that then produces no output, with no
 * indication why; then firing an empty table. PFM_CycleBoundaryHandler()
 * (the ISR-driven playback advance, see stm32g4xx_it.c's
 * HRTIM1_Master_IRQHandler()) already defends against g_pfmEntryCount
 * == 0 by stopping outputs again at the very first master-repetition
 * interrupt -- but that would happen silently, after a near-instant
 * blip on the outputs, with no error ever reported to the operator.
 * Rejecting both here instead gives a clear reason up front.
