/* --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * GDS?
 *
 * Raw HIGH/LOW snapshot of all 12 GateDriverStatus pins (PE0..PE11,
 * gate_driver.h) -- added 2026-09-08 as a diagnostic while chasing why
 * a fault wasn't being registered. Deliberately a single OK line (one
 * "NN=HIGH" or "NN=LOW" token per pin, NN = 01..12 matching the
 * GateDriverStatus_01..12 silkscreen/schematic numbering, space
 * separated, PE0 first) rather than the sibling PFM-STM32G474
 * project's multi-line/bitmask GDS? formats -- matches this project's
 * existing single-"OK <value>"-line convention (commands.h) instead of
 * introducing a new multi-line reply shape for just this one command.
 * Raw and uncached like the sibling project's GDS?: reads GPIOE->IDR
 * live at the moment of the query, no debounce, no polarity
 * interpretation, no fault-latching of its own -- this command itself
 * is read-only visibility and cannot stop PWM output by itself. (These
 * same 12 pins DO now gate PWM output, via a separate path: the
 * GateDriverStatus EXTI interrupt, gate_driver.h's
 * GateDriver_CheckFault(), added 2026-09-08 -- GDS? is unaffected by
 * and independent of that mechanism, just a raw snapshot either way.)
