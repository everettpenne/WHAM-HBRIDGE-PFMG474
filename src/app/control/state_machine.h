/*
 * state_machine.h / state_machine.c -- the top-level operating state,
 * added 2026-09-29 (Phase 3 of the port from WHAM-XREX-PFMG474, whose
 * state_machine.h this mirrors: same names, same states, a subset of its
 * features).
 *
 *   IDLE  --ARM-->  ARMED  --FIRE-->  FIRING  --table ends-->  IDLE
 *     ^               |                  |
 *     +----DISARM-----+                  |
 *   any state --fault--> FAULT --FAULT:CLEAR (sources clear)--> IDLE
 *
 * - ARM is refused unless IDLE and no fault source is latched. Nothing
 *   electrical happens on ARM.
 * - FIRE (SM_Fire()) is refused unless ARMED and the table is non-empty;
 *   it starts table playback (PFM_Restart()) and enters FIRING. When the
 *   table is exhausted the PFM engine stops the output by itself and the
 *   next SM_PollFaults() returns to IDLE -- every shot needs a fresh ARM.
 * - ONE fault type (SM_FAULT_GENERAL), by design for this product: every
 *   source -- PC10/HRTIM1_FLT6 (native HRTIM fault input) and the 12
 *   GateDriverStatus inputs (gate_driver.h) -- lands in the same FAULT
 *   state. The response is an immediate force-stop of the output
 *   (PFM_ForceStop()), no ramp-down. The output is already safe before
 *   this module even sees the fault: PC10 gates the HRTIM outputs in
 *   hardware, and GateDriver_CheckFault() force-stops from the EXTI
 *   interrupt; this module makes the state say so and keeps it latched.
 * - FAULT:CLEAR (SM_ClearFault()) clears both sources, which re-check the
 *   physical inputs; if either is still bad the fault re-latches and the
 *   state stays FAULT. Otherwise IDLE -- never straight back to ARMED.
 *
 * Not ported from XREX (not part of this product, or deferred): the PID
 * ramp-downs, per-channel fault types, the external enable/trigger inputs
 * (PF13/PF15), DEBUG:FAULT:BYPASS and telemetry events.
